# Guess the number
Little try out of realizing a beautiful classic algorithm of *binary search* guessing
a random number in a range from 0 to 100.


Computer sets a number in a range, I do my utmost to guess. And we repeat the game 
1000 times to get the mean number of approaches I need.   

Goals of the project are: 

    + practice in writing a clean an readable code;
    + practice in defining functions; 
    + practice in choosing appropriate algorithm.
